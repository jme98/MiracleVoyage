# Miracle Voyage

Your daughter is sick with a terrible disease, and nothing you've tried has helped.  Your only hope is to pursue rumors of a man named "Jesus," who can supposedly raise the dead and restore the sight of the blind by the power of God.

Explore the town, talk with curious strangers, and embark on a dangerous voyage to find the man you've heard so much about.
